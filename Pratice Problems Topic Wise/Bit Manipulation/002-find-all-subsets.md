## Code Snippet 1:

```cpp
for (size_t j = 0; j < i.size(); j++) {
    cout << i[j];
    if (j < i.size() - 1) {
        cout << " ";
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

1. `for (size_t j = 0; j < i.size(); j++) {`:
   - This line starts a `for` loop where `j` is the loop variable of type `size_t` (an unsigned integer type).
   - `j` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than the size of the vector `i` (`i.size()`).
   - In simple terms, this loop iterates through all the elements of the vector `i` one by one.

2. `cout << i[j];`:
   - Inside the loop, this line prints the current element of the vector `i` at index `j`.
   - `i[j]` accesses the element of the vector `i` at the current index `j`.

3. `if (j < i.size() - 1) {`:
   - This line checks if `j` is not the index of the last element in the vector `i`. It does this by comparing `j` to `i.size() - 1`. If `j` is not the last element, the condition is true, and the following code block is executed. If `j` is the last element, the code block is skipped.

4. `cout << " ";`:
   - Inside the conditional block, this line prints a space character. However, it only does so if `j` is not the index of the last element in the vector. The purpose of this is to add a space between elements, but not after the last element.

## Code Snippet 2:

```cpp
cout << "{"; // Print the opening curly brace
copy(i.begin(), i.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " ")); // Copy elements with spaces
cout << "\b}"; // Remove trailing space and add a closing curly brace
```

**Explanation**:

1. `cout << "{";`:
   - This line is used to print the opening curly brace `{` to indicate the start of the set.

2. `copy(i.begin(), i.end(), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));`:
   - This part uses the `std::copy` algorithm to copy elements from the vector `i` to the standard output (cout) with spaces in between.
   - `i.begin()`: It represents the iterator pointing to the beginning of the vector `i`.
   - `i.end()`: It represents the iterator pointing to one position past the end of the vector `i`.
   - `ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " ")`: This constructs an output iterator that writes to the standard output (`cout`) and separates elements with a space `" "`.

3. `cout << "\b}";`:
   - After copying the elements with spaces, this part does the following:
     - `cout << "\b"`: This prints a backspace character (`\b`). A backspace character moves the cursor one position backward, effectively erasing the character that was printed before it.
     - `}`: This part prints a closing curly brace `}` to indicate the end of the set.

The result of this code is that it prints the elements of the vector `i` separated by spaces, enclosed within curly braces, while ensuring that there is no extra space after the last element.
